About
=====

The 'profiles/' directory contains the observed surface brightness
profiles for GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL, and IRAS. The different bands are
indicated by a two character code:

    I1 = IRAC 3.6 microns
    I2 = IRAC 4.5 microns
    I3 = IRAC 5.8 microns
    I4 = IRAC 8.0 microns
    M1 = MIPS 24 microns
    S3 = IRAS 60 microns
    S4 = IRAS 100 microns

The longitude profiles are indicated by the '_lon' suffix, and the
latitude profiles by the '_lat' suffix. Each file contains the longitude
or latitude in degrees, followed by the surface brightness in MJy/sr.
