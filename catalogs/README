About
=====

The 'profiles/' directory contains the observed surface brightness
profiles for the sources in the GLIMPSE point source Archive. The
different bands are indicated by a two character code:

    I1 = IRAC 3.6 microns
    I2 = IRAC 4.5 microns
    I3 = IRAC 5.8 microns
    I4 = IRAC 8.0 microns
    
Each file contains the longitude in degrees, followed by the surface
brightness in MJy/sr.
